 **#Live Bihar Assembly Election Result Dashboard – Power BI**
This repository contains a real-time Power BI dashboard that displays the Bihar Assembly Election Results using live data sourced from the Election Commission of India (ECI).

The Election Commission blocks direct API or web URL connections to Power BI, so this project implements a custom workflow to extract, clean, and update election data automatically—making the dashboard refresh live throughout the counting process.

**Project Highlights**
Live, auto-refreshing election result dashboard
Real-time data extracted directly from the ECI portal
Custom data ingestion pipeline to bypass direct Power BI restrictions

**Interactive visualizations for:**
Party-wise results
Seat trends
Constituency-wise status
Candidate-wise performance

**Tech Stack**
Power BI Desktop
Power Query (M)
Web Scraping Techniques
Automation Scripts

**Output**
A first-of-its-kind Power BI dashboard that displays live Bihar Assembly election results, despite official restrictions on direct data connections—demonstrating skills in BI engineering, automation, and real-time analytics.
